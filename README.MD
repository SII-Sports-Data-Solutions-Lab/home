## Overview

The project leverages customer review data collected from multiple e-commerce and fitness review platforms. It uses LDA to identify key topics and performs sentiment analysis to understand customer perceptions. The insights generated aim to guide product development, marketing strategies, and further research in digital fitness equipment.

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Automated data scraping, text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and feature extraction.
- **Topic Modeling:** Identification of main topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Evaluation of overall and feature-based sentiments within reviews.
- **Direct Database Connection (Electron Only):** In controlled environments, direct PostgreSQL connection is used for data display and CSV export.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring dynamic components like project roadmap, team profiles, and dataset information.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, React Router, Recharts
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (direct connection for Electron apps; for production, use a secure backend)
- **Other Libraries:** pg, react-query, react-transition-group

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. For development, run:
